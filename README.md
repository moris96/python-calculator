# Introducing: Python Calculator made with the tkinter module
## to install tkinter, open terminal (mac/linux) or command prompt on windows and type: pip install tkinter
### other pip installs for this app to work for you: pip install numpy , pip install math

#### for special buttons to work like square root or x squared, first select a number and then something like x squared or sin)

# Image of calculator (will make it look better in the future, but all the buttons work):
