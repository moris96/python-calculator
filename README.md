# python-calculator is currently in development
## still in a buggy alpha state lol, but again, it's still in development 
### working updates: (all buttons minus pi have to select the number first then something like x³ for example)
  * pi 
  * square root 
  * x², x³, x^n (same process as square root, as with all the other advanced math stuff being added for now)
  * trig: sin, cos, tan, sin-1, cos-1, tan-1 
  * log, ln
  * (-): makes a number negative
